**Final Project Rules**

* **Presentation Date:** During the semester break (we missed a class entirely during the semester, so we can’t fit these presentations into regular class time).

* **Group Work:**

  * The project is normally done in pairs. You may work individually, but if you choose a partner, your presentation will be scheduled last so that anyone who needs to leave early can go by doing a solo presentation earlier.

* **Presentation Time:**

  * Each group (or individual) has **8 minutes** to present their work.

* **Project Objective:**

  * Demonstrate the use of algorithms covered in the course.
  * Show understanding of when and why unsupervised learning methods are appropriate.

* **Algorithm Requirement:**

  * Because some algorithms suit different tasks (and some are used for preliminary analysis), it’s hard to predict exactly what your project will look like.
  * **Expectation:** Use at least **two different algorithms** from the course (i.e., from two separate lessons).

    * These two algorithms can address the same problem or be chained—e.g., one algorithm preprocesses data for the next.

* **Recommended Slide Structure (6–7 slides):**

  1. **Problem Statement**

     * Which data you collected and what you are trying to discover.
     * Why supervised methods aren’t appropriate (no labels).
  2. **Data Preparation**

     * Any transformations you performed (normalization, dimensionality reduction, etc.) and their rationale.
  3. **Background on Your Model(s)**

     * Brief explanation of how each chosen algorithm works.
  4. **First Model**

     * What you did and how it performed.
  5. **Second Model (or Improvement on First Model)**

     * Describe the second algorithm or how you enhanced/tuned the first.
  6. **Additional Model Checks**

     * Examples: stability analysis, sensitivity to different parameters, etc.
  7. **Conclusion**

     * Summarize how the model(s) performed and the practical usefulness of your results.

* **Deliverables:**

  * You must also submit:

    1. **Project Code** and **Dataset** so others can replicate your work.
    2. A **short written summary** (1–2 pages) addressing the same points as your slides.
  * It’s acceptable to submit the code and summary up to **one week after** your presentation, giving you time to polish and document your work.

* **Grading Breakdown:**

  * **Final Project:** 90% of the course’s final grade.

**Interim Presentation (10% of Final Grade)**

* **Purpose:** Ensure you’re on the right track before the final submission.
* **Content:**

  1. **Data Source:** Where your data comes from.
  2. **Why Unsupervised:** Why you need unsupervised methods and cannot use supervised learning (no labels exist for what you want to detect).
* **Length & Format:**

  * Approximately **4 slides**, **5 minutes** in total.
  * Cover:

    1. **Where did the data come from?**
    2. **Why is this data interesting?**
    3. **What are you trying to detect or find?**
    4. **Why isn’t it suitable for supervised methods?** (i.e., no labels exist for your target).

### Essential To-Do List Based on These Instructions

1. **Assemble Your Team**

   * Choose a partner (or decide to work solo). If you partner up, expect to present last.

2. **Select & Collect Data**

   * Identify or gather an unlabeled dataset relevant to an unsupervised task.
   * Make sure your data has no ground-truth labels for what you intend to detect.

3. **Plan Interim Presentation**

   * Prepare 4 slides (\~5 minutes) addressing:

     1. Data source and why it’s interesting.
     2. Your specific discovery goal.
     3. Why no labels exist (necessitating unsupervised methods).

4. **Choose Two Unsupervised Algorithms**

   * Decide on at least two different algorithms from course lessons (e.g., K-Means + PCA, DBSCAN + LDA, Hierarchical clustering + UMAP).
   * Determine if you will chain them (one to preprocess, another to cluster) or apply them independently.

5. **Data Preparation & Preprocessing**

   * Document any transformations (normalization, scaling, dimension reduction) and explain why each step is needed.

6. **Implement & Evaluate Models**

   * **Model 1:** Describe the first algorithm, implement it, and analyze performance.
   * **Model 2 (or Enhancement):** Apply a second algorithm or improve the first (e.g., parameter tuning, ensemble, or combining methods).
   * **Additional Checks:** Test stability, vary parameters, or perform cross-validation for unsupervised metrics.

7. **Create Final Slides (6–7 slides, 8 minutes)**

   * Follow the recommended structure: problem → data prep → model background → model results → improvements → additional checks → conclusion.
   * Practice staying within the 8-minute window.

8. **Prepare Written Summary**

   * Write a 1–2 page document that mirrors your slide content:

     1. Problem statement & data description
     2. Preprocessing steps and rationale
     3. Algorithm explanations and results
     4. Additional evaluation and practical conclusions

9. **Submit Code & Data**

   * Package your code and dataset in a repository or compressed archive.
   * Provide instructions so others can reproduce your work.
   * Submit these materials within one week after your final presentation.

10. **Deliver Final Presentation**

    * Present during the semester break.
    * Ensure clarity, cohesion, and that both team members participate (if in a pair).
